# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As long as this project is being maintained, all versions are "supported", or at
least, I'll do my best to provide as much help as a solo developer can offer.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is a personal project, however, I would love it if people used this for
whatever application they want. If you find an issue or vunerability, please let
me know. Open an issue, or even better, a pull request, I'd be thrilled to merge
it. If you need to privately report a vulnerability, you can fillout a new
[security advisory](https://github.com/norwd/.github/security/advisories/new).
